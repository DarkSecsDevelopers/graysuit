### Imprisonment 
Welcome idiots, I am also an big idiot (don't matters) But I learned a lot from my idiotic steps. Due to I am student and I was spending my part time here I am leaving
due to my studies is an hurdle in github and github is hurdle in studies. But I choose to study (Because all elders and senior recommended it).
<br><br>
I came here for finding phishing pages. And while editing and correcting I learned making phishing pages (took me 6 months). grayfish is final product. https://github.com/graysuit/grayfish
<br>
And I also learn many programming languages in past 3 years by just editing, removing and playing with codes. Visual Basic is my favourite language.
<br><br>
I am good nor bad(you have to), So thats why I am gray. <br>
Likewise if you set light theme It will tease your eyes and if you use black theme You will see nothing. So use gray theme.
