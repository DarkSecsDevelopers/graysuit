# About 
I am an **uncertified** and **self-taught programmer** who believes in performance with **minimal** and **native** code. 
## Experience
I started this programming journey since 2018. I have used many **frameworks** and **languages** but I will list only in which I have **discipline** and **maturity**:<br>
**Xamarin.Forms.Android** (C#),**Windows Forms** (both dotnet & native), **Scripting** (Visual Basic for Application,Javascript,Batch,Bash,Powershell,Python etc), **Web development** (php,js,html,css) and much more.<br>
I don't want to make the page as a **story book**. ;)
